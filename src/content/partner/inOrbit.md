We know that sometimes just getting a robot to work is a challenge. Besides mechanical engineering, assembling hardware components, and developing application software, your robotics team must be able to manage a remote and distributed fleet of robots.

We have partnered with InOrbit, the global leader in RobOps (DevOps for robotics) so you can get the benefit of a dedicated development team and a scalable, secure platform for robot management. Now, instead of having to build an ad hoc solution that consumes precious time and money, you can be up and running in 61 seconds with InOrbit, while we develop custom extensions and application-specific software to meet your specific needs.

InOrbit and Ekumen understand startups and our offerings are designed to grow with your company: you can get started on InOrbit for free and then pay a monthly fee based on your usage. InOrbit is Software-as-a-Service so there’s no infrastructure for you to worry about. Through our strategic partnership with InOrbit, we can help create robot-specific configurations, use APIs to create custom extensions and help inform InOrbit’s product roadmap.

Get the best of both worlds with Ekumen and InOrbit. Contact us now or visit [inorbit.ai](https://www.inorbit.ai/) to learn more.
