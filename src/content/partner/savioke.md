We are fortunate to serve as a key development partner for Savioke, developer and designer of the Relay indoor delivery robot. Since 2015, we’ve supported the Savioke team with a unique, integrated and multidisciplinary approach to product development services and technology. And, as our relationship with Savioke expanded, we also helped recruit, hire and train key talent to grow their team.

We strictly follow Savioke's commitment to quality and excellence, and take to heart Savioke’s goal of safety and extraordinary human experience. It’s a privilege to work with a first class robotics company, like Savioke, bringing our talented people to work alongside theirs to create a thoughtfully designed delivery robot.
