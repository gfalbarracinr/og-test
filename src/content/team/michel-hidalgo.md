Michel is an Electrical Engineering student from the National Technologic University.
He is passionate about human knowledge as a whole, specially when it comes to STEM fields,
physics and engineering being his first choice.

He's a fast learner: in a couple months, he picked up with ROS, Gazebo, Grunt, AngularJS,
Docker and Ansible technologies to name a few, consistently delivering value to customers
when simulating, building, interfacing or deploying their robotic solutions.

In his free time, if not spent with his family or friends, he likes to watch
a good movie and play his old guitar.
