In today's rapidly evolving world, technology is shaping the future, and robotics is playing a pivotal role in this transformation. At Ekumen, we are committed to breaking down barriers and making robotics accessible to everyone. With that commitment in mind, we proudly introduce Andino – an innovative open-source differential drive robot designed specifically for educational purposes. Andino is more than just a robot; it's a testament to innovation, affordability, and inclusivity. Notably, Andino is compatible with ROS 2 Humble and can be constructed with a budget of less than USD300, making it a game-changing solution for education and technology.

Andino's foundation is rooted in ROS-based frameworks such as ROS Control, Gazebo, Slam-Toolbox, and Nav2. These integrations empower educators and students alike to explore robotics concepts in a simulated environment, fostering learning and experimentation. But we don't stop there – we're committed to extending its capabilities by integrating it with other emerging cutting-edge frameworks like Open-RMF. This approach transforms Andino into a versatile platform that showcases a diverse range of applications achievable through ROS.

## The motivation behind Andino

At Ekumen, we've been promoting robotics education across Latin America. We've organized workshops, talks, and conferences, extending robotics knowledge to schools, universities, and communities. However, we identified a critical hurdle that hindered self-directed learning – the lack of accessible, low-budget educational robots. Andino emerged as the answer to this challenge, bridging the gap and fostering engagement among students and enthusiasts who aspire to embark on their robotics journey.

Andino began as a prototype within our yearly hackathons, and since then, a lot has happened. It has now become publicly available, and its journey has been remarkable. Andino has been successfully used for applying SLAM techniques, autonomous navigation, and even as a platform for testing out brand-new projects also initiated by Ekumen, such as Beluga – a high-performing implementation of Monte Carlo Localization algorithms.
